# XDR (eXternal Data Representation) 

"e**X**ternal **D**ata **R**epresentation (XDR) is a standard data serialization format, for uses such as computer network protocols. It allows data to be transferred between different kinds of computer systems. Converting from the local representation to XDR is called **encoding**. Converting from XDR to the local representation is called **decoding**. XDR is implemented as a software library of functions which is portable between different operating systems and is also independent of the transport layer." _from Wiki_

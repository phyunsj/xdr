# XDR (eXternal Data Representation) 

"e**X**ternal **D**ata **R**epresentation (XDR) is a standard data serialization format, for uses such as computer network protocols. It allows data to be transferred between different kinds of computer systems. Converting from the local representation to XDR is called **encoding**. Converting from XDR to the local representation is called **decoding**. XDR is implemented as a software library of functions which is portable between different operating systems and is also independent of the transport layer." ..._from Wiki_

> XDR uses a base unit of 4 bytes, serialized in big-endian order; smaller data types still occupy four bytes each after encoding. Variable-length types such as string and opaque are padded to a total divisible by four bytes.

## XDR Stream Access

|Files | In-Memory| Record | 
|-|-|-|
|xdrstdio_cretae|xdrmem_create|xdrrec_create||

Must specify the below operations :
- XDR_ENCODE : serialise (encode) in-memory structures onto the wire.
- XDR_DECODE : deserialise (decode) from the wire into in-memory structures.
- XDR_FREE : free an in-memory structure.
